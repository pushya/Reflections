When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all 
your work local?

When something I am working on is completed and I want to make it 
available to public.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may not want the new changes in the remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would 
you use one instead of another?

fork:
-fork is similar to clone.You clone a repository from another to your 
account in GitHub.You do this when you want to make changes to another's 
code without requesting permissions from that person.

clone:
-clone is for getting a repository on GitHub to your local computer.

branch:
-branch is when you want to experiment with the existing code while 
maintaing a copy of that code.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the 
remote stored locally?

So that you compare the state of the remote and your local repository 
even when you are offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be 
easier, and what would be harder?

I would collaborate by working on same computer or sharing files.Using 
git and GitHub is far easier than that.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than 
directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

When you are collaborating with someonelse or when you want to create 
another version or experiment.
