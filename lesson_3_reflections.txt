When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all 
your work local?

When something I am working on is completed and I want to make it 
available to public.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may not want the new changes in the remote repository.
