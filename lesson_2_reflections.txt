What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository a .git directory will be added to the 
directory in which the repository was initialized.
Through this .git you track the history of your files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is diffrent from working directory and repository in the 
sense that it stores the files temporaryly.
It allows us to group all the files whose changes you want to commit.
